PACMAN

You are Pacman, and you are supposed to eat all the small dots to get to the
next level. You are also supposed to keep away from the ghosts, if they take
you, you lose one life, unless you have eaten a large dot, then you can, for a
limited amount of time, chase and eat the ghosts. There is also bonus
available, for a limited amount of time. An X gives just points, but a little
pacman gives an extra life.

You use either keyboard or mouse. Default from start is keyboard.

Keyboard mode: To move use arrows, to quit, press q, to use mouse, press m
Mouse mode: To move, move mouse, to quit, press RButton, to use
keyboard, press LButton

Details: When pacman has moved to a new place, if you want it to change
it's moving direction, hit key/move mouse until it has moved.

STARTUP BW/COLOURS

Colouring is default, it may alse work on grey monitors
If it don't work, and you got to use grey, write pacman grey

NOTE

(The mentioned #defines is in basis.h.)
The pacman window puts itself on top, comment out #define RAISE if you
don't like it.
The pacman program can deal with exposing, that is, redrawing itself
after overlapping with other windows, but it's naive, primitive and
far from perfect, comment out #define XPOSSE if you don't need it.

If you want the game to run smooth, don't use a loaded machine/server.

And if you want a larger window, uncomment #define DOUBLE (you can also
do the same by uncommenting in the Imakefile).

COMPILING

Two possibilities: use xmkmf or if that doesn't work, gen:

xmkmf:
xmkmf -a        # this makes the Makefile and the dependencies
		# continue and
                # try ordinary make even if xmkmf gives errors
make; make install; make clean
#this uses Imakefile, which I am very fresh at...

gen:
#Program gen uses makeg to make the makefile.
#then use ordinary make.
#It may have to be customized because of
#individual compiler configurations.
gen
make
